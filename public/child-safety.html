  <h1>TCGtrade - Child Safety Standards</h1>
  
  <section>
    <h2>1. Zero-Tolerance Policy</h2>
    <p>
      TCGTrade has a strict zero-tolerance policy for any form of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) 
      or exploitation of minors. We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for all users.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Reporting Harmful Content</h2>
    <p>
      Users can report suspected CSAM or child safety concerns directly within the app through the in-app 
      "Report" feature, or by contacting us via email at 
      <a href="mailto:havihavi@live.com">havihavi@live.com</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Response Process</h2>
    <p>
      All reports are reviewed by our moderation team within 24 hours. If CSAM is confirmed, the content 
      is removed immediately, the offending accounts are banned, and relevant authorities are notified.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
    <p>
      We comply with all applicable child protection laws and report confirmed CSAM cases to national 
      and regional law enforcement agencies, including cybercrime units, as required by law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Prevention Measures</h2>
    <p>
      We use automated systems and manual review to detect and block harmful content, 
      and we continuously update our safety measures to improve detection and prevention.
